This article explains how to solve Docker Hub’s Pull Rate Limit on CI/CD pipelines using Organization Access Tokens.

## The Impact of Docker Hub's Pull Rate Limit on CI/CD pipelines

Starting April 1, 2025, [unauthenticated Docker users will be limited to 10 pulls per hour from Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/) (Pull Rate Limit).

If the Pull Rate Limit is exceeded, the following message will be displayed.

```console
You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit
```

If you are already using Docker Desktop in your local development environment, simply signing in to Docker Desktop will resolve this issue.

However, **if your CI/CD pipelines rely on pulling images from Docker Hub, be aware that they are more susceptible to the impact of the Pull Rate Limit**.

This is because:

- Various parts of the CI/CD pipelines require pulling images from Docker Hub.
  - Docker build → The base image needs to be pulled from Docker Hub.
  - Using Docker containers as the CI/CD execution environment (e.g., Docker Executor in CircleCI).
  - Running tests using Docker containers, such as with Testcontainers, Selenium.
- Since multiple developers trigger the CI/CD pipelines, the number of pulls from Docker Hub tends to be higher than in local development environments.
- In particular, managed CI/CD services provide a clean environment for each pipeline execution, meaning that local images are not retained in a cache, and pulling from Docker Hub is often necessary.

* Some CI/CD services (such as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/private-images/)) may currently be exempt from the limit. However, if you are using a self-hosted runner, you may be subject to the limit.

In the past, a solution was to [create a Docker Personal Access Token](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/) and log in to Docker Hub within the CI/CD pipelines.

However, **since a Personal Access Token is tied to an individual user, it is preferable to avoid using it in CI/CD pipelines**.

This use case is an example of what Organization Access Tokens are designed to address.

## What are Organization Access Tokens?

The Organization Access Token is a feature available to users with a [Docker Team or Business subscription](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

The Organization Access Token allows access tokens to be issued and managed at the Organization level within a subscription, rather than being tied to an individual user.

As a result, **there is no need to worry about tokens being linked to personal user accounts like Personal Access Tokens, making it possible to manage access tokens for CI/CD pipelines more securely**.

## Create Organization Access Tokens

The steps to create an Organization Access Token are as follows:

- Only users with Owner permissions for the Organization or Company can perform this operation.

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin)
2. Select the organization you want to create an access token for.
3. Under **Security and access**, select **Access tokens**.
4. Select **Generate access token**.
5. Enter the Label, Access Token Description, and Expiration Date.
6. Configure the repository access permissions for the token.
   - **Public repositories (read only)**
   - **All repositories**: You can select read access, or read and write access.
   - **Select repositories**: You can select up to 50 repositories, and then select read access, or read and write access for each repository.
7. Select **Generate token** and then copy the token that appears on the screen and save it.

## Use Organization Access Tokens in CI/CD pipelines

Once the Organization Access Token has been issued, save it as a secret in each CI/CD platform and ensure that `docker login` is executed before the step that pulls the image from Docker Hub.

### Using Docker CLI (AWS CodeBuild, Jenkins, GitLab CI)

You can log in using the Docker CLI `docker login` command by specifying `--username` as the target Organization name and `--password` as the Organization Access Token.

Here is an example pipeline for AWS CodeBuild:

```yaml
version: 0.2

env:
  secrets-manager:
    DOCKER_ORG: ${SECRETS_NAME}:DOCKER_ORG
    DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN: ${SECRETS_NAME}:DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo "$DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN" | docker login --username $DOCKER_ORG --password-stdin

  build:
    commands:
      - docker build --push --tag user/app:latest .
```

Here is an example pipeline for Jenkins:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    DOCKER_ORG: credentials('docker-org')
    DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN: credentials('docker-org-token')
  }

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'echo "$DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN" | docker login --username $DOCKER_ORG --password-stdin'
        sh 'docker build --push --tag user/app:latest .'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example pipeline for GitLab CI:

```yaml
docker-build:
  image: docker:cli
  stage: build
  services:
    - docker:dind
  before_script:
    - echo "$DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN" | docker login --username $DOCKER_ORG --password-stdin
  script:
    - docker build --push --tag user/app:latest .
```

### GitHub Actions (docker/login-action)

Set the `username` in [docker/login-action](https://github.com/docker/login-action) to the target Organization name and the `password` to the Organization Access Token.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ vars.DOCKER_ORG }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```

### The CI execution environment uses Docker containers (CircleCI Docker Executor)

When using a Docker container as the CI/CD execution environment, such as the CircleCI Docker Executor, configure the workflow to authenticate with Docker Hub before pulling images.

Set `auth.username` to the target Organization name and `auth.password` to the Organization Access Token.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: myorg/myrepo
        auth:
          username: $DOCKER_ORG
          password: $DOCKER_ORG_TOKEN
    steps:
      - run: echo "hello"
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how Docker Hub's Pull Rate Limit can impact CI/CD pipelines and how Organization Access Tokens provide a secure and scalable solution. By using these tokens, teams can ensure uninterrupted access to Docker Hub while improving security and manageability. Implementing this approach will help streamline CI/CD workflows and prevent disruptions caused by rate limits. Start using Organization Access Tokens today to enhance your CI/CD pipeline efficiency.
